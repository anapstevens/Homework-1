    <h1>Antibiotic Resistance</h1>
    <h2>How a bad problem is becoming a worse problem.</h2>
    <h3>What is antibiotic resistance?</h3>
	<p>Antibiotic resistance is the loss of effectiveness of anitbiotics against bacterial pathogens. This means that drugs that were previously used to fight disease are no longer effective.</p>
    <h3>How does antibiotic resistance happen?</h3>
	<p>Our use and overuse of antibiotics to treat all manner of ailments has selected for bacterial genes that give resistance to antibiotics. In other words, the bacteria aren't "getting smarter"; We use so many antibiotics that the only bacteria that survive are the ones that are resistant to our drugs.</p>
    <h3>What does antibiotic resistance mean for me?</h3>
	<p>It means that when you or your loved ones get sick, the medicines we used to be able to use are unlikely to work as well as they have in the past. Along with the "anti-vaxxers" who refuse to vaccinate their children, disease is more dangereous than it's been in a long time.</p>
    <h3>"Anti-vaxxers" are idiots.</h3>
	<p class="other">Yes, they are.</p>

    <h3>What can I do to help fix the problem?</h3>
	<p>Unless you're on the forefront of pharmaceuticals and actively creating new antibacterial drugs, there isn't much you can do. The way you can help fight the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is to use antibiotics as little as possible. Only take them if prescribed to you for a bacterial infection (NOT the flu!). Also, unless you are (or someone you spend a lot of time with is) immunocompromised, there's no reason to regularly use antibacterial soap.</p>
